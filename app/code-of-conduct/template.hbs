  <p class="t-body">If a participant engages in harassing behavior, conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling him or her from the conference. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns regarding violations of this policy, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.</p>
  <p class="t-body">The conference staff is happy to help participants contact venue staff or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or in any other way assist those experiencing harassment. Having a safe environment for our conference participants is of paramount importance to us, and we value your help towards creating this space.</p>
